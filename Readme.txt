Overview
The objectives of the project is to develop a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to predict it. The program will record how many attempts the user made to estimate the correct response and will let them know if their guess was high or low. It also enables users to Quit at any time. Finally, the user's total number of guesses, highest score and amount of time they took to guess correctly will be presented once correct number is predicted.

How to use the Program
It is very easy to use and enjoy the game. User will be asked to give input for prediction and also provides the option of quitting at any time by pressing "q". Moreover there is no limit on number of attempts to guess the exact number. Once user enters the Guess it will be processesed and user will be given hint if the guess is low or high to help user to predict the number. Once predicted the right answer, results will be displayed along with number of guesses took, time taken to predict the right answer and high score. Finally, user will be asked if he wants to continue playing or not.

Dependencies
1. Integer input is required to play the game, if decimal input is provided it will be coverted to integer and processed.
2. If invalid input is given it will prompt "Invalid input! Please enter a number" and chance will not be counted for number of guesses.
3. Although the secret number will be from 1 to 100 but user can enter any number which is not even in the range of 1 to 100.
4. Quitting the game is only possible with q. This is case sensitive.
