# Seminar-KI-in-der-Logistik-Project-
The objectives of the project is to develop a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to predict it. The program will record how many attempts the user made to estimate the correct response and will let them know if their guess was high or low. It also enables users to Quit at any time.
